## Overview

Jasmine is used to write test suites for different specification on the program at hand.
When written application have correct logic and features, test suite should show error free messages indicating all the functionality you tested from your code. Otherwise a failure message will display including specific encountered issue.

## Instructions

From the files, run index.html and test suite results should show. If all is green and good, it will indicate total number of specifications  written from different test suites.
If one of the expectations is not met in terms of functionality or feature of your program or code it will indicate red with failure and other details might be given e.g. line number where the error is streaming from.
